# `ConsumerLoanAssistant Project `

# Abstract :
<p> It's a Consumer Loan Assistant/Analysis Project. The purpose of this project is to determine how many years later a person will be completely paid back with interest (e.g., if a man takes a loan or borrows some money from a bank or any organisation with interest, he will be completely paid back with interest at that prediction).

 # Overview : 
 <p>
 In this project, we will build a consumer loan assistant. You input a loan balance and yearly interest
 rate. You then have two options: (1) enter the desired number of payments and the loan assistant
 computes the monthly payment, or (2) enter the desired monthly payment and the loan assistant
 determines the number of payments you will make. An analysis of your loan, including total of
 payments and interest paid is also provided.
 The finished project is saved as LoanAssistant in the \HomeJava\HomeJava Projects\ project
 group. Start NetBeans (or your IDE). Open the specified project group. Make LoanAssistant the
 main project. Run the project. You will see:

All label controls are used for title information. Two button controls are used to compute results
and to start a new analysis. Two small button controls (marked with X; only one is seen at a time)
control whether you compute the number of payments or the payment amount. One button exits the
project. Four text field controls are used for inputs and a large text area is used to present the loan
analysis results.
The loan assistant appears as:
In this initial configuration, you enter a Loan Balance, an Interest Rate (annual rate as a
percentage) and a Number of Payments value. Click Compute Monthly Payment. The payment
will appear in the ‘yellow’ text field and a complete loan analysis will appear in the large text
field. Here are some numbers I tried :

So, if I borrow $2,50,000 at 5.5% interest, I will pay $1,500 for three years (324 months). More
specific details on exact payment amounts, including total interest paid, is shown under **Loan
Analysis**.
